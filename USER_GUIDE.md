# Business Risk Intelligence Platform - User Guide

## What This Tool Does

This platform helps General Counsels and legal teams proactively manage business risks by automatically analyzing your company's legal documents, contracts, and communications against current events and regulatory changes.

Think of it as having a team of legal analysts working 24/7 to monitor risks that could impact your business, but powered by AI.

## Key Problems This Solves

### 1. **Manual Document Review is Time-Consuming**
- **Current Problem**: Your team spends hours manually reviewing contracts to understand obligations when events occur
- **Our Solution**: Upload your documents once, and the system automatically extracts and analyses all relevant information

### 2. **Reactive Risk Management**
- **Current Problem**: You only discover risks after they've already impacted your business
- **Our Solution**: Proactive monitoring and early warning alerts when events could trigger contract obligations

### 3. **Information Silos**
- **Current Problem**: Important context about your company is scattered across different systems and people
- **Our Solution**: Centralized repository of company information, documents, and risk analysis
